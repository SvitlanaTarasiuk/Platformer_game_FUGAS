My exam project "Adventures Fox"

Unity 2021.3.9f1

“ADVENTURES FOX” is an adventure platform game.
In it, a brave fox goes in search of adventures and treasures, incredible adventures and dangers await him on the way, he will see incredible worlds. At the end of the game, he must fight a troll, after defeating which the bald man will get all the gold that the troll was guarding.
The main gameplay mechanic of the game is jumping, which helps to overcome most obstacles, such as various spikes, spiky ground and hanging platforms, fire or an abyss. The hero has a weapon - a blaster that shoots an electric charge and can kill dangerous creatures he meets or an evil troll at the end of the game. 
During the game, the fox collects coins, electric charges for the blaster and food, which it immediately eats, leaving only bones.

Managing a hero in Windows:
- walk: right / left; 
- jump - Space; 
- shoot - Enter.

There are also buttons to control the hero on Android.

The game can be played online:https://tarasiuk-svitlana.itch.io/adventures-fox
